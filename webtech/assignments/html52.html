<p>Hand-held devices and software, such as LeapFrog tablets and smartphones, have been co-opted into young children’s playing and learning for a period of time. Many studies have been conducted about using them effectively in educational contexts so that their positive potential impact could be boosted. For example, in the studies conducted by Disney, Barnes, McDowall and Geng (2013), it was found that the use of an iPad could enhance young children’s engagement in their learning and playing. Therefore, the use of hand-held devices is becoming more accepted in terms of a developmentally appropriate learning device used during children playtime. (Chou & Lee, 2012) With the growing rate of technology today it is assumed that the majority of children living in the United States have viewed or played with some form of an electronic toy. The toys of today have come a long way from the days of building blocks and Lincoln logs that once held prime status in every toy store. This paper will serve to show the benefits that electronic toys can have on the brain development of a child with a focus on the effects that an iPad and similar devices can have on the development of a child’s brain. </p>
